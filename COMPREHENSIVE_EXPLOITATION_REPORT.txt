=========================================================

Target: https://pigslot.co / https://jklmn23456.com
Test Date: 2025-07-28 11:50:15
Test User: 0960422161 (Customer: PS663888386)

üí• EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
===================
Advanced privilege escalation testing performed using authenticated user account
to verify admin-force vulnerability and test for remote access capabilities.

üö® ADMIN-FORCE VULNERABILITY TEST:
=================================
Status: VULNERABLE
Admin-force endpoint accessible: YES
Response size: 10424 bytes
Admin indicators found: admin


üéØ ADMIN API DISCOVERY:
======================
No admin APIs accessible


üñ•Ô∏è REMOTE COMMAND EXECUTION:
===========================
No remote command execution detected


üìÅ FILE UPLOAD TESTING:
======================
No file uploads successful


üõ°Ô∏è RISK ASSESSMENT:
==================
Overall Risk Level: LOW
Impact Level: LOW

Discovered Vulnerabilities:
1. Admin-Force Authentication Bypass: CONFIRMED
2. Unauthorized Admin API Access: NO
3. Remote Command Execution: NO
4. Arbitrary File Upload: NO

üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
=============================
üü° MEDIUM: Admin-force vulnerability confirmed - Disable endpoint


‚ö†Ô∏è EXPLOITATION SUMMARY:
========================
This test demonstrates the security posture of the application when accessed
with valid user credentials. The results show potential privilege escalation
vectors that could be exploited by authenticated users.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Patch all discovered vulnerabilities immediately
2. Implement proper role-based access control
3. Add server-side authorization checks
4. Monitor for suspicious admin access attempts
5. Regular security audits and penetration testing
