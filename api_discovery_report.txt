- JavaScript files analyzed: ✅
- Endpoints found in HTML: 0
- Endpoints found in JS: 0
- API endpoints tested: 0

🎯 DISCOVERED ENDPOINTS:

📁 Common Admin Endpoints:

🔐 SECURITY ANALYSIS:

Authentication Status:
- Admin login page: Accessible but requires credentials
- Common credentials failed: admin/admin, administrator/administrator, etc.
- No obvious authentication bypass found

Potential Attack Vectors:
1. Brute force attack on discovered endpoints
2. Parameter fuzzing on API endpoints
3. Directory traversal attempts
4. SQL injection testing on form inputs
5. XSS testing on input fields

🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:

1. Manual Browser Analysis:
   - Use browser with ZAP proxy to navigate admin panel
   - Try different login combinations
   - Monitor ZAP GUI for additional traffic

2. Advanced Testing:
   - Use tools like Burp Suite or ZAP Spider
   - Test for SQL injection on login form
   - Check for CSRF vulnerabilities
   - Test file upload functionality if available

3. API Security Testing:
   - Test discovered APIs with different HTTP methods
   - Check for authentication bypass
   - Test for privilege escalation
   - Look for information disclosure

⚠️  IMPORTANT NOTES:
- All testing conducted through ZAP proxy for traffic analysis
- No successful authentication achieved with common credentials
- Further manual analysis recommended for complete assessment
- Ensure proper authorization before continuing testing
