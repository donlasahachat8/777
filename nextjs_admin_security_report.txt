üéØ NEXT.JS ADMIN PANEL SECURITY ANALYSIS REPORT
=====================================================

Target: https://pigslot.co/admin-force
Technology: Next.js Application  
Analysis Date: 2025-07-28 11:52:25
ZAP Proxy: 46.202.177.106:8080

üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
====================
- Admin panel detected: ‚úÖ https://pigslot.co/admin-force
- Application type: Next.js
- Authentication status: Analysis required
- API endpoints discovered: 0
- Admin-specific endpoints: 0  
- Bypass attempts: 0

üîç DISCOVERED API ENDPOINTS:
===========================

‚ùå No active API endpoints discovered with standard methods

üîí No successful authentication bypasses found

üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY ASSESSMENT:
======================

Application Security Posture:
‚Ä¢ Next.js framework detected
‚Ä¢ Admin panel accessible at /admin-force
‚Ä¢ Standard API discovery methods show limited results
‚Ä¢ No obvious authentication bypass vulnerabilities

üéØ IDENTIFIED VULNERABILITIES:
=============================
üü¢ NO CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES - Standard analysis shows secure configuration

üéØ RECOMMENDED EXPLOITATION STEPS:
=================================

1. MANUAL ANALYSIS:
   ‚Ä¢ Use browser with ZAP proxy to manually navigate admin panel
   ‚Ä¢ Attempt different authentication methods
   ‚Ä¢ Monitor all requests/responses in ZAP GUI

2. CREDENTIAL ATTACKS:
   ‚Ä¢ Brute force common admin credentials
   ‚Ä¢ Try SQL injection on any login forms
   ‚Ä¢ Test for default/weak passwords

3. API SECURITY TESTING:
   ‚Ä¢ Test discovered APIs with different HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE)
   ‚Ä¢ Parameter fuzzing on API endpoints
   ‚Ä¢ Test for privilege escalation

4. CLIENT-SIDE ANALYSIS:
   ‚Ä¢ Analyze Next.js JavaScript bundles for hardcoded credentials
   ‚Ä¢ Look for client-side authentication logic
   ‚Ä¢ Check for exposed API keys or tokens

5. ADVANCED TECHNIQUES:
   ‚Ä¢ Session manipulation and fixation
   ‚Ä¢ CSRF testing on admin functions
   ‚Ä¢ File upload vulnerabilities
   ‚Ä¢ Directory traversal attempts

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
===========================
‚Ä¢ All testing performed through ZAP proxy for traffic analysis
‚Ä¢ Next.js applications may have client-side routing that requires manual analysis
‚Ä¢ API endpoints may be dynamically generated and not discoverable through automated scanning
‚Ä¢ Manual browser interaction strongly recommended for complete assessment

üîç NEXT STEPS:
=============
1. Set up browser proxy through ZAP and manually navigate the admin panel
2. Use ZAP Spider/Active Scan features for deeper analysis  
3. Analyze JavaScript bundles for client-side vulnerabilities
4. Test any discovered functionality for privilege escalation
